Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, has always been among the top 3 cities with the worst air quality worldwide. Dhaka's air quality is getting worse every day since it's one of the world's most densely inhabited cities and because of its overcrowding, transportation, and industrialization. Many deadly diseases, including respiratory, cardiovascular, cancer, neurological disorders, etc., are caused by air pollution. This project intends to predict the Air Quality Category to reduce these effects using machine learning. This paper aims to know the AQI Category based on some given pollutant (PM2.5) concentrations monitored in Dhaka for the past two years (2022,2023). The study utilized the Scikit-learn library to implement four machine-learning algorithms. We also used Explainable AI (LIME) to visualize the prediction results. We have also used smote to balance the class distribution. The evaluation metrics for these algorithms for the classification task were precision, recall, accuracy, and f1-score. The result shows that XGBoost and K-Nearest Neighbor achieved the highest cross-validation scores of 84.9% and 82.6%, respectively.
